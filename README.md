## üß† AI Algorithm ‚Äî NegaMax + Alpha-Beta Pruning

The AI uses the NegaMax variant of the Minimax algorithm, enhanced with Alpha-Beta pruning to efficiently evaluate moves.

- Evaluates material score + positional value (piece-square tables)
- Supports pruning for faster decision-making
- Depth-based difficulty system: higher depth = stronger play
